(byzanz-record:13605): Gdk-WARNING **: The program 'byzanz-record' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadCursor (invalid Cursor parameter)'.
  (Details: serial 116 error_code 6 request_code 142 minor_code 25)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the GDK_SYNCHRONIZE environment
   variable to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
